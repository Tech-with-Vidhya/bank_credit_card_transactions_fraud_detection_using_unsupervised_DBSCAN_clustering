# bank_credit_card_transactions_fraud_detection_using_unsupervised_DBSCAN_clustering
This project deals with the segmentation and grouping of the bank credit card fraud transactions using UnSupervised Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Clustering Algorithm.  The project involves below steps in the life-cycle and implementation.  1. Data Exploration and Analysis 2. Data Pre-Processing, Scaling and Normalisation 3. Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 4. Model Fitting 5. Model Hyper Parameters Tuning 6. Model Validation using Performance Quality Metrics namely Silhouette Coefficient/Score and Homogeneity Score 7. Optimized Model Selection with appropriate number of clusters based on the various Performance Quality Metrics
